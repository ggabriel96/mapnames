# mapnames

This is the repository for the code of my Computer Science bachelor's degree final paper. You can read more about the tackled problem in the [problem description](doc/problem_description.pdf), although I am not strictly following the contest rules anymore (because it's over). The documentation is a work in progress (and mainly in the code itself).

# Getting started

Currently, the most up-to-date branch is `filtering`. Dependencies can be installed via:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
